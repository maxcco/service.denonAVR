# Denon autoMode Plugin for Kodi (service.denonAVR)

## How it works

Once installed in kodi, you need to setup the ip address of your Denon AVR in extension settings.
It will run as soon as you start kodi as a service and will send a request (similar to pressing the remote button) to activate either the movie mode or the music mode.
